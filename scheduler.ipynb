    "You don't care about the ordering of the interviews, I.E. you have no preference to say \"I would like to go to the UF interview before the FSU interview\" assuming both were chosen. What this means - this scheduler assumes if you are going to both, you don't care about which day you go if one is on say 11/12 and the other is on 11/13. It's going to randomly pick one. This probably works for virtual interviews, but it's not very realistic for physical interviews. \n",
