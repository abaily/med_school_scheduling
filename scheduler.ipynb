    "## Assumptions\n",
    "You don't care about the ordering of the interviews, I.E. you have no preference to say \"I would like to go to the UF interview before the FSU interview\" assuming both were chosen. What this means - this scheduler assumes if you are going to both, you don't care about which day you go if one is on say 11/12 and the other is on 11/13. It's going to randomly pick one. This probably works for virtual interviews, but it's not very realistic for physical interviews. \n",

    "## How to Use this Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, under the options at the top of google colab, select runtime. Select \"Change Runtime Type\" and under hardware accelerator, select \"GPU\".\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each cell containing code needs to be run individually. Next to each cell, there is a play button visible when you hover over the cell. Follow the instructions in the first several blocks, then run the code sequentially, clicking the play button in each cell. Make sure you run the cell immediately beneath these instructions. \n",
    "\n",
    "* You have two options for importing a file, you can either import from your google drive, or from your computer. Follow the instructions under \"Import Files from Google Drive\" or \"Import Files from Computer\". After that, you'll modify the cells under User Modified Values. Be sure to use the example formatting if you have blackout dates or selected schools."
