# med_school_scheduling
Scheduler for med_school interview dates using a scheduling problem integer programming approach. This notebook will require user input, which will be documented throughout the notebook. To begin, you'll need a csv (comma seperated value sheet), similar to the one in the repository labeled "school date tracker"

This CSV will need the school names in the 1st column, acceptance to the interview program, indicated with a 1 for accepted and a 0 for unaccepted, and all subsequent cells in the row indicating interview dates. 

To use the notebook, click the "open in colab" button, which will launch the notebook in google colab.
