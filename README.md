# med_school_scheduling
Scheduler for med_school interview dates. This notebook will require user input, which will be documented throughout the notebook. To begin, you'll need a csv (comma seperated value sheet), similar to the one in the repository labeled "school date tracker". You can import the csv from your computer or from google drive. 

This CSV will need the school names in the 1st column, acceptance to the interview program, indicated with a 1 for accepted and a 0 for unaccepted, and a column for priority, where a higher number indicates more priority. All subsequent cells in the row indicate interview dates in the format 'mm/dd'. 

To use the notebook, click the "open in colab" button, which will launch the notebook in google colab.
